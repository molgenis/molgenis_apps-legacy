How to install WormQTL:

* Download the data:
	wget http://molgenis26.target.rug.nl/downloads/wormqtl_jan2012.tar.gz

* Extract into your data folder.
	For example: /Users/jvelde/data/[extracted content of tar.gz]

* Run the Ant script to build the application:
	ant -f build_wormqtl.xml clean-generate-compile

* Start the application
	ant -f build_wormqtl.xml run

* Go to http://localhost:8080/xqtl_panacea/
	Check if you get the 'database setup success' message

* Go to http://localhost:8080/xqtl_panacea/autohideloginswitch
	Login with 'admin', pw 'admin'
	
* In the setup screen, enter the path of the data directory,
	Minus the 'xqtl_panacea', so e.g. "/Users/jvelde/data"
	Click 'Load' and wait
	
* You should get the message WormQTL 'specific annotation import and data relink succeeded'
	At this point you are technically done, but:
	- Go to 'Browse data' and change the investigation name 'Panacea' to 'Public',
	the origin name is not correct. (there is more data then Panacea in the database!)
	- Change the admin password, use the autohideloginswitch URL to get to the
	login/logout screen. Do the same for the 'bio-user' and 'bioinfo-user'. Their
	default passwords are 'bio' and 'bioinfo'.
	- Logout and check as anonymous if everything works
	
* Make sure a recent R version is installed so your plots are working

* Make sure the server is running with a proper external IP so the Genome Browser works
