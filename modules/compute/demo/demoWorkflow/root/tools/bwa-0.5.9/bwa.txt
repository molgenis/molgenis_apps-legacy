DESCRIPTION
       BWA  is  a  fast  light-weighted  tool  that  aligns  relatively  short
       sequences  (queries)  to a sequence database (targe), such as the human
       reference genome. It implements two different algorithms, both based on
       Burrows-Wheeler  Transform  (BWT).  The first algorithm is designed for
       short queries up to ~200bp with low error rate (<3%).  It  does  gapped
       global  alignment w.r.t. queries, supports paired-end reads, and is one
       of the fastest short read alignment algorithms to date while also  vis-
       iting  suboptimal  hits.  The second algorithm, BWA-SW, is designed for
       long reads with more errors. It performs heuristic  Smith-Waterman-like
       alignment  to  find high-scoring local hits (and thus chimera). On low-
       error short queries, BWA-SW is slower and less accurate than the  first
       algorithm, but on long queries, it is better.

       For  both  algorithms,  the  database  file in the FASTA format must be
       first indexed with the `index' command, which  typically  takes  a  few
       hours.  The first algorithm is implemented via the `aln' command, which
       finds the suffix array (SA) coordinates of good hits of each individual
       read,  and  the `samse/sampe' command, which converts SA coordinates to
       chromosomal coordinate and pairs reads (for `sampe'). The second  algo-
       rithm  is invoked by the `bwasw' command. It works for single-end reads
       only.


COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
       index  bwa index [-p prefix] [-a algoType] [-c] <in.db.fasta>

              Index database sequences in the FASTA format.

              OPTIONS:

              -c        Build color-space index. The input fast should  be  in
                        nucleotide space.

              -p STR    Prefix of the output database [same as db filename]

              -a STR    Algorithm   for   constructing  BWT  index.  Available
                        options are:

                        is     IS linear-time algorithm for constructing  suf-
                               fix  array. It requires 5.37N memory where N is
                               the size of  the  database.  IS  is  moderately
                               fast,  but  does  not work with database larger
                               than 2GB. IS is the default  algorithm  due  to
                               its  simplicity. The current codes for IS algo-
                               rithm are reimplemented by Yuta Mori.

                        bwtsw  Algorithm implemented in  BWT-SW.  This  method
                               works  with the whole human genome, but it does
                               not work with database smaller than 10MB and it
                               is usually slower than IS.


       aln    bwa aln [-n maxDiff] [-o maxGapO] [-e maxGapE] [-d nDelTail] [-i
              nIndelEnd] [-k maxSeedDiff] [-l seedLen] [-t nThrds] [-cRN]  [-M
              misMsc]  [-O  gapOsc]  [-E  gapEsc]  [-q trimQual] <in.db.fasta>
              <in.query.fq> > <out.sai>

              Find the SA coordinates of the input reads. Maximum  maxSeedDiff
              differences  are  allowed  in  the first seedLen subsequence and
              maximum maxDiff differences are allowed in the whole sequence.

              OPTIONS:

              -n NUM    Maximum edit distance if the  value  is  INT,  or  the
                        fraction  of  missing alignments given 2% uniform base
                        error rate if FLOAT. In the latter case,  the  maximum
                        edit  distance  is  automatically chosen for different
                        read lengths. [0.04]

              -o INT    Maximum number of gap opens [1]

              -e INT    Maximum number of gap extensions, -1 for  k-difference
                        mode (disallowing long gaps) [-1]

              -d INT    Disallow  a  long  deletion  within INT bp towards the
                        3'-end [16]

              -i INT    Disallow an indel within INT bp towards the ends [5]

              -l INT    Take the first INT subsequence  as  seed.  If  INT  is
                        larger  than  the query sequence, seeding will be dis-
                        abled. For long reads, this option is typically ranged
                        from 25 to 35 for `-k 2'. [inf]

              -k INT    Maximum edit distance in the seed [2]

              -t INT    Number of threads (multi-threading mode) [1]

              -M INT    Mismatch  penalty.  BWA will not search for suboptimal
                        hits with a score lower than (bestScore-misMsc). [3]

              -O INT    Gap open penalty [11]

              -E INT    Gap extension penalty [4]

              -R INT    Proceed with suboptimal alignments  if  there  are  no
                        more  than  INT  equally  best  hits. This option only
                        affects paired-end mapping. Increasing this  threshold
                        helps  to  improve the pairing accuracy at the cost of
                        speed, especially for short reads (~32bp).

              -c        Reverse query but not complement it, which is required
                        for alignment in the color space.

              -N        Disable  iterative  search. All hits with no more than
                        maxDiff differences will be found. This mode  is  much
                        slower than the default.

              -q INT    Parameter  for read trimming. BWA trims a read down to
                        argmax_x{\sum_{i=x+1}^l(INT-q_i)} if q_l<INT  where  l
                        is the original read length. [0]

              -I        The input is in the Illumina 1.3+ read format (quality
                        equals ASCII-64).

              -B INT    Length of barcode starting from the 5'-end.  When  INT
                        is  positive, the barcode of each read will be trimmed
                        before mapping and will be written at the BC SAM  tag.
                        For  paired-end  reads, the barcode from both ends are
                        concatenated. [0]

              -b        Specify the input read sequence file is the  BAM  for-
                        mat.  For  paired-end data, two ends in a pair must be
                        grouped together and options  -1  or  -2  are  usually
                        applied to specify which end should be mapped. Typical
                        command lines for mapping pair-end  data  in  the  BAM
                        format are:

                            bwa aln ref.fa -b1 reads.bam > 1.sai
                            bwa aln ref.fa -b2 reads.bam > 2.sai
                            bwa sampe ref.fa 1.sai 2.sai reads.bam reads.bam >
                        aln.sam

              -0        When -b is specified, only  use  single-end  reads  in
                        mapping.

              -1        When  -b  is  specified,  only use the first read in a
                        read pair in mapping (skip single-end  reads  and  the
                        second reads).

              -2        When  -b  is  specified, only use the second read in a
                        read pair in mapping.


       samse  bwa samse [-n maxOcc] <in.db.fasta> <in.sai> <in.fq> > <out.sam>

              Generate  alignments  in  the SAM format given single-end reads.
              Repetitive hits will be randomly chosen.

              OPTIONS:

              -n INT    Maximum number of alignments to output in the  XA  tag
                        for reads paired properly. If a read has more than INT
                        hits, the XA tag will not be written. [3]

              -r STR    Specify   the   read   group   in   a   format    like
                        `@RG\tID:foo\tSM:bar'. [null]


       sampe  bwa sampe [-a maxInsSize] [-o maxOcc] [-n maxHitPaired] [-N max-
              HitDis] [-P] <in.db.fasta> <in1.sai> <in2.sai> <in1.fq> <in2.fq>
              > <out.sam>

              Generate  alignments  in  the SAM format given paired-end reads.
              Repetitive read pairs will be placed randomly.

              OPTIONS:

              -a INT  Maximum insert size for a read  pair  to  be  considered
                      being  mapped properly. Since 0.4.5, this option is only
                      used when there are not enough good alignment  to  infer
                      the distribution of insert sizes. [500]

              -o INT  Maximum  occurrences  of a read for pairing. A read with
                      more occurrneces will be treated as a  single-end  read.
                      Reducing this parameter helps faster pairing. [100000]

              -P      Load  the  entire  FM-index  into  memory to reduce disk
                      operations (base-space reads only). With this option, at
                      least 1.25N bytes of memory are required, where N is the
                      length of the genome.

              -n INT  Maximum number of alignments to output in the XA tag for
                      reads paired properly. If a read has more than INT hits,
                      the XA tag will not be written. [3]

              -N INT  Maximum number of alignments to output in the XA tag for
                      disconcordant  read  pairs  (excluding singletons). If a
                      read has more than INT hits, the  XA  tag  will  not  be
                      written. [10]

              -r STR  Specify    the    read    group   in   a   format   like
                      `@RG\tID:foo\tSM:bar'. [null]


       bwasw  bwa  bwasw  [-a  matchScore]  [-b  mmPen]  [-q  gapOpenPen]  [-r
              gapExtPen]  [-t nThreads] [-w bandWidth] [-T thres] [-s hspIntv]
              [-z zBest] [-N nHspRev] [-c thresCoef] <in.db.fasta> <in.fq>

              Align query sequences in the <in.fq> file.

              OPTIONS:

              -a INT    Score of a match [1]

              -b INT    Mismatch penalty [3]

              -q INT    Gap open penalty [5]

              -r INT    Gap extension penalty. The penalty  for  a  contiguous
                        gap of size k is q+k*r. [2]

              -t INT    Number of threads in the multi-threading mode [1]

              -w INT    Band width in the banded alignment [33]

              -T INT    Minimum score threshold divided by a [37]

              -c FLOAT  Coefficient  for  threshold  adjustment  according  to
                        query length. Given an l-long query, the threshold for
                        a hit to be retained is a*max{T,c*log(l)}. [5.5]

              -z INT    Z-best heuristics. Higher -z increases accuracy at the
                        cost of speed. [1]

              -s INT    Maximum SA interval size for initiating a seed. Higher
                        -s increases accuracy at the cost of speed. [3]

              -N INT    Minimum  number  of  seeds  supporting  the  resultant
                        alignment to skip reverse alignment. [5]


SAM ALIGNMENT FORMAT
       The output of the `aln' command is binary  and  designed  for  BWA  use
       only.  BWA  outputs  the  final  alignment  in the SAM (Sequence Align-
       ment/Map) format. Each line consists of:

       When seeding is disabled, BWA guarantees to find an alignment  contain-
       ing  maximum  maxDiff  differences including maxGapO gap opens which do
       not occur within nIndelEnd bp towards either end of the  query.  Longer
       gaps  may  be found if maxGapE is positive, but it is not guaranteed to
       find all hits. When seeding is enabled, BWA further requires  that  the
       first  seedLen  subsequence  contains  no more than maxSeedDiff differ-
       ences.

       When gapped alignment is disabled, BWA is expected to generate the same
       alignment  as  Eland,  the  Illumina alignment program. However, as BWA
       change `N' in the database sequence  to  random  nucleotides,  hits  to
       these  random sequences will also be counted. As a consequence, BWA may
       mark a unique hit as a repeat, if the random  sequences  happen  to  be
       identical to the sequences which should be unqiue in the database. This
       random behaviour will be avoided in future releases.

       By default, if the best hit is no so repetitive (controlled by -R), BWA
       also  finds  all  hits contains one more mismatch; otherwise, BWA finds
       all equally best hits only. Base quality is NOT considered in  evaluat-
       ing hits. In paired-end alignment, BWA pairs all hits it found. It fur-
       ther performs Smith-Waterman alignment for unmapped  reads  with  mates
       mapped  to rescue mapped mates, and for high-quality anomalous pairs to
       fix potential alignment errors.


   Estimating Insert Size Distribution
       BWA estimates the insert size distribution per 256*1024 read pairs.  It
       first  collects  pairs of reads with both ends mapped with a single-end
       quality 20 or higher and then calculates median (Q2), lower and  higher
       quartile  (Q1  and  Q3).  It estimates the mean and the variance of the
       insert size distribution from  pairs  whose  insert  sizes  are  within
       interval  [Q1-2(Q3-Q1), Q3+2(Q3-Q1)]. The maximum distance x for a pair
       considered to be properly paired (SAM flag 0x2) is calculated by  solv-
       ing  equation  Phi((x-mu)/sigma)=x/L*p0, where mu is the mean, sigma is
       the standard error of the insert size distribution, L is the length  of
       the  genome,  p0  is  prior of anomalous pair and Phi() is the standard
       cumulative distribution function.  For  mapping  Illumina  short-insert
       reads  to  the  human  genome, x is about 6-7 sigma away from the mean.
       Quartiles, mean, variance and x will be printed to the  standard  error
       output.


   Memory Requirement
       With  bwtsw  algorithm,  2.5GB memory is required for indexing the com-
       plete human genome sequences. For short reads, the `aln'  command  uses
       ~2.3GB memory and the `sampe' command uses ~3.5GB.


   Speed
       Indexing the human genome sequences takes 3 hours with bwtsw algorithm.
       Indexing smaller genomes with IS or divsufsort  algorithms  is  several
       times faster, but requires more memory.

       Speed of alignment is largely determined by the error rate of the query
       sequences (r). Firstly, BWA runs much faster for near perfect hits than
       for  hits  with many differences, and it stops searching for a hit with
       l+2 differences if a l-difference hit is found. This means BWA will  be
       very  slow if r is high because in this case BWA has to visit hits with
       many differences and looking for these hits is expensive. Secondly, the
       alignment  algorithm  behind makes the speed sensitive to [k log(N)/m],
       where k is the maximum allowed differences, N the size of database  and
       m  the  length of a query. In practice, we choose k w.r.t. r and there-
       fore r is the leading factor. I would not recommend to use BWA on  data
       with r>0.02.

       Pairing  is  slower  for  shorter reads. This is mainly because shorter
       reads have more spurious hits and converting SA coordinates to  chromo-
       somal coordinates are very costly.

       In a practical experiment, BWA is able to map 2 million 32bp reads to a
       bacterial genome in several minutes, map the same amount  of  reads  to
       human  X  chromosome  in  8-15 minutes and to the human genome in 15-25
       minutes. This result implies that the speed of BWA  is  insensitive  to
       the size of database and therefore BWA is more efficient when the data-
       base is sufficiently large. On smaller genomes, hash  based  algorithms
       are usually much faster.


NOTES ON LONG-READ ALIGNMENT
       Command  `bwasw'  is  designed  for  long-read alignment. The algorithm
       behind, BWA-SW, is similar to BWT-SW, but does not  guarantee  to  find
       all local hits due to the heuristic acceleration. It tends to be faster
       and more accurate if the  resultant  alignment  is  supported  by  more
       seeds,  and  therefore  BWA-SW  usually performs better on long queries
       than on short ones.

       On 350-1000bp reads, BWA-SW is several to tens of times faster than the
       existing  programs. Its accuracy is comparable to SSAHA2, more accurate
       than BLAT. Like BLAT, BWA-SW also finds chimera which may pose a  chal-
       lenge to SSAHA2. On 10-100kbp queries where chimera detection is impor-
       tant, BWA-SW is over 10X faster than BLAT while being more sensitive.

       BWA-SW can also be used to align ~100bp reads, but it  is  slower  than
       the  short-read  algorithm.  Its sensitivity and accuracy is lower than
       SSAHA2 especially when the sequencing error rate is above 2%.  This  is
       the  trade-off of the 30X speed up in comparison to SSAHA2's -454 mode.

HISTORY
       BWA  is  largely influenced by BWT-SW. It uses source codes from BWT-SW
       and mimics its binary file formats; BWA-SW resembles BWT-SW in  several
       ways.  The  initial  idea  about BWT-based alignment also came from the
       group who developed BWT-SW. At the same time, BWA is  different  enough
       from  BWT-SW. The short-read alignment algorithm bears no similarity to
       Smith-Waterman algorithm any more. While BWA-SW learns from BWT-SW,  it
       introduces  heuristics that can hardly be applied to the original algo-
       rithm. In all, BWA does not guarantee to find all local  hits  as  what
       BWT-SW  is  designed  to  do, but it is much faster than BWT-SW on both
       short and long query sequences.

       I started to write the first piece of codes on 24 May 2008 and got  the
       initial  stable  version  on  02  June  2008. During this period, I was
       acquainted that Professor Tak-Wah  Lam,  the  first  author  of  BWT-SW
       paper,  was collaborating with Beijing Genomics Institute on SOAP2, the
       successor to SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package).  SOAP2  has
       come  out in November 2008. According to the SourceForge download page,
       the third BWT-based short read aligner, bowtie, was first  released  in
       August  2008.  At  the time of writing this manual, at least three more
       BWT-based short-read aligners are being implemented.

       The BWA-SW algorithm is a new component of BWA.  It  was  conceived  in
       November 2008 and implemented ten months later.
